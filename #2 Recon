We perform basic nmap scan to see open ports and version of the service that work on it.
nmap -sV -sC -Pn 10.10.230.14


Only 3 ports open on the machine:
80 - Microsft IIS httpd 7.5 and its just a webserver
3389 - Remote RDP
8080 and it's our Jenkins


Ok, let's go then and see our victim port, 10.10.230.14:8080
On this port I find a page which only contain the image and Email alfred@wayneenterprises.com
I tried default credentials admin:admin and we are able to acess the backend 
It was defenitely 2 easy, now we are looking for a feature of the tool that allows you to execute commands on the underlying system, so we can upload our Nishang reverse shell.

We created the new project in Jenkins Go to new item -> EnterName and select Freestyle project -> Next -> Go into Build section select the Execute window batch command
